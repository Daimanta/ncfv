ncfv -- A fork of the unmaintained file content verification program 'cfv' originally written by Matthew Mueller
Current maintainer -- LÃ©on van der Kaap -- leonkaap [at] gmail.com


Requirements:
  Python >= 2.4           http://www.python.org/

Optional:
  Python Imaging Library  http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
    (only needed if you want to create the dimensions column of .crc files)
  python-fchksum          http://www.dakotacom.net/~donut/programs/fchksum.html
    (may speed up checksumming speed a bit, especially if your python
     wasn't built with the mmap module.)

Unix Install:
1) make install (which just runs "python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local")
2) read man page, cfv -h, etc.  have fun.
3) optional: run tests to verify correct operation: cd test; ./test.py

Windows Install:
1) maybe python setup.py install will do something useful?  At least it should
  stick the libraries in the right place.
2) move cfv.bat to somewhere in the path
3) Edit the cfv.bat file if your python is installed somewhere other than 
  c:\python24
